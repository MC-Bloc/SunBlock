# How To Build A SunBlock 
`W.I.P.`

One of the objectives of the SunBlock project is to, in true Minecraft spirit, enable you to *craft your own SunBlock*. 

If you're here, you're curious how to build your own SunBlock. 

As explained in the [intro](./README.md), you will need to put together everything for each layer of the server. While we can provide some of the material for the logical and game layers, you will need the components for the physical layer. 

## Setting up the Physical layer. 

This step starts at procuring the parts, connecting them, and then installing a linux-based OS on the SunBlockCore-PL. 

## Setting up the Logical Layer 

This step start with setting up the CubeCoders AMP instance, setting up the data stream, to getting it live on the web. 

## Setting up the Game Layer 

The final step involves launching an instance for SunBlock and getting the instance ready with solar data. 

## Congratulations!
And there we have it, you have your very own *SunBlock*! Have fun!
