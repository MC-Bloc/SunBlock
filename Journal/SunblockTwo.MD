I have just completed mounting the system on the painted case.

Also mounted the fan and the power connection shows that the system is live.

When the motherboard, RAM, and SSD for SB2 originally arrived, I wired it up and installed a copy of Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (i.e. without a GUI/desktop) on it; Then shut it down since I didn't have anything to do on it. 
I want to keep a server install so that everything that is done, is done through a terminal command and there is a log, a history of everything done to this system. Especially since this server will/should not be accessed with a screen, it will be mounted and left in a corner. 

I don't exactly remember when I installed the OS  was but its there. I'm not too certain about the install or what else I did on it so I might reinstall the OS. 

Lets see now. Going to try booting the system now. Will report back with more later.
